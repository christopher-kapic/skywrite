# Public media and live provider validation

The normal Rust test suite works offline and uses generated media. Public media
and paid calls are opt-in. Run from the repository root:

```sh
cargo test --locked --offline
python3 scripts/validate-public-media.py prepare
python3 scripts/validate-public-media.py
```

`prepare` downloads short AMI Meeting Corpus excerpts through FFmpeg HTTP seeks;
it needs network access and FFmpeg. The default directory is
`/tmp/skywrite-public-validation`, outside the repository. It stores source URLs,
derived-file SHA-256 hashes, and attribution there. Existing files are reused.
The default `check` mode runs real microphone alignment offline, checks expected
offset and clock scale, and validates existing analysis/edit artifacts. It removes
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from child processes. If live transcript artifacts exist, it
also proves that the exact cached transcription works without a key.

The source is AMI Consortium's ES2002a meeting: Headset-0, Array1-01,
Mix-Headset, and Closeup1 video. The audio excerpts cover original seconds 30..150;
the video covers 30..60. AMI's [download page](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/download/)
licenses signals and transcriptions under
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Preserve the generated
attribution file with distributed excerpts or rendered demonstrations. The two
derived microphone fixtures change the array sample rate to 16160 or 16002 Hz,
resample to 16000 Hz, then prepend 2 or 1 seconds of silence.

To explicitly permit bounded live requests:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate-public-media.py live --allow-paid --paid-budget 0.25
```

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the environment or pass `--key-file /private/path`.
Never add credentials to the repository. Use a server-side key spending cap.
The script records key usage before/after and checks observed spending before
each request; this is a stop threshold, not an atomic provider billing cap.
There are four bounded operations: 30 seconds of word transcription, four-frame
video understanding, 30 seconds of audio understanding, and an edit suggestion.
The current model is configurable with `--model`; transcription uses the CLI's
default. Existing successful output files are reused, exact API responses are
cached, and failed paid requests are never retried automatically. Inspect saved
stderr and response-cache evidence before deliberately changing a request.

On 2026-10-30, the original debug CLI at commit `d10b9ef` completed live validation
using `openai/whisper-large-v3` and `google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite`:

| Executed check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Headset versus table microphone | offset−0.979ms; scale+54.64ppm;11anchors over112s |
| Array sped up1.01×, delayed2s | expected offset−2.02s/scale1.01; error2.171ms/64.92ppm |
| Array sped up125ppm, delayed1s | expected offset−1.000125s/scale1.000125; error0.594ms/50.60ppm |
| Real speech transcription |77provider-timestamped words, including meeting introduction and participant roles |
| Visual understanding | Remote control, glasses, plaid shirt and listening posture independently checked against sampled frames |
| Audio-only understanding | Kick-off meeting topic agrees with AMI manual annotation |
| Suggested edit and render | Validated 8 s, two video clips and one 5 s audio overlay;384×288,25 fps, 200 frames, H264/AAC |

Alignment quality was reported `limited`: sparse overlapping speech and acoustic
propagation constrain the result. The checks allow 20 ms offset error and 250 ppm
scale error, rather than treating public microphones as exact electronic copies.
The rendered output has audible-source samples during its first 5 seconds and a
silent final 3 seconds; the sampled rendered frame depicts the remote demonstration.
It is an editorial cutaway, not measured lip synchronization.

Seven deliberately issued requests cost `$0.0082159` in total, matching the key
usage delta from0. This includes two rejected outputs and a low-signal probe:
the nearly silent individual headset produced an unreliable “Thank you” result;
the initial array transcription contained slightly unsorted provider word starts
and was rejected; an initial suggested edit copied `$schema` metadata and was
rejected without writing an edit. An explicit brief requiring an edit instance
without schema metadata then succeeded. Those observations are provider-quality
and integration limits, not evidence of guaranteed transcription/editorial
accuracy. No timestamp was fabricated. The source-mix introduction and role names
were checked against AMI manual word annotations; timestamps remain ASR estimates.

The provider word-order issue was subsequently fixed in ingestion. Replaying the
identical failed array response from cache without an API key succeeded with all
42 original word text/start/end values preserved, chronological starts, and an
explicit reordering diagnostic. This replay checks the actual saved provider
response; it does not issue or charge another request.

Per-request logs, raw cached responses, source annotations, cost records and the
rendered demonstration from that run were saved outside git under
`/tmp/skywrite-run/public`. Subsequent implementation fixes require fresh
validation; this dated evidence does not certify later source changes.
